## Stateful Component

All of the components that we have worked with till now have been simple in a sense that they have not contained any state that could change during the life cycle of the component.

In this section, we will add a state to our Application's `App` component with the help of React's **state hook**

**All notes are provided with the working example in the same directory `counter with state hook`**

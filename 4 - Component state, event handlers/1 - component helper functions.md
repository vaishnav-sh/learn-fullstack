## Component helpers functions

Let's start this with an example:

```js
const Hello = (props) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>
        Hello {props.name}, you are {props.age} years old
      </p>
    </div>
  );
};

const App = () => {
  const name = "Peter";
  const age = 10;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Greetings</h1>
      <Hello name="Maya" age={26 + 10} />
      <Hello name={name} age={age} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

Let's optimize our `Hello` component so that it guesses the year of birth of the person being greeted:

```js
const Hello = (props) => {
  const bornYear = () => {
    const yearNow = new Date().getFullYear();
    return yearNow - props.age;
  };
  return (
    <div>
      <p>
        Hello {props.name}, you are {props.age} years old
      </p>
      <p>So you were probably born in {bornYear()}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

const App = () => {
  const name = "Peter";
  const age = 10;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Greetings</h1>
      <Hello name="Maya" age={26 + 10} />
      <Hello name={name} age={age} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

- **The logic for guessing the year of birth is separated into a function of its own that is called when the component is rendered.**
- Such kind of a function is called _component helper_

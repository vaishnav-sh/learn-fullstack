## Page re-rendering

So far all of our applications have been such that their appearance remains the same after the initial rendering. What if we wanted to create a counter where the value increased as a function of time or at the click of a button?

For the solution, **refer: `counter` folder in the same directory**

> **Making repeated calls to the ReactDOM.render method is not the recommended way to re-render components. We will cover how to do this the right way in the upcoming topics**

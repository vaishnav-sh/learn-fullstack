# Altering data in the server

- When adding new notes in our application, we would naturally want to store them in some backend server. The `json-server` package claims to be a so-called REST or RESTful API.

- The json-server does not exactly match the description provided by the textbook definition of a REST API, but neither do most other APIs claiming to be RESTful.

- it's important to familiarize ourselves at this point with some of the conventions used by json-server and REST APIs in general. In particular, we will be taking a look at the conventional use of routes, aka URLs and HTTP request types, in REST.

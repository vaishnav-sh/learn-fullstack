## JavaScript

The official name of the JavaScript standard is **ECMAScript**. At this moment, the latest version is the one released in June of 2021 with the name ECMAScriptÂ®2021, otherwise known as **ES12**.

- Browsers do not yet support all of JavaScript's newest features
- Thus, a lot of code run in browsers has been transpiled from a newer version of JavaScript to an older, more compatible version.
- Today, the most popular way to do the transpiling is by using Babel.
- Transpilation is automatically configured in React applications created with create-react-app.

### **Node.js**

- Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment based on Google's Chrome V8 JavaScript engine and works practically anywhere - from servers to mobile phones.
- The latest versions of Node already understand the latest versions of JavaScript, so the code does not need to be transpiled.
- The code is written into files ending with .js that are run by issuing the command `node name_of_file.js`
- It is also possible to write JavaScript code into the Node.js console, which is opened by typing node in the command-line, as well as into the browser's developer tool console.
- The newest revisions of Chrome handle the newer features of JavaScript pretty well without transpiling the code.
- Alternatively you can use a tool like JS Bin.

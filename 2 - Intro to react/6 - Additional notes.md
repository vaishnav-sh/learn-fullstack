## Additional Notes

- React has been configured to produce clear and concise error messages.
- However you should always keep the `console` tab and use `console.log()` wherever necessary to debug your code.
- React components must be capitalized, you define a component like this:

```js
const footer = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      greeting app created by <a href="https://github.com/mluukkai">mluukkai</a>
    </div>
  );
};
```

and use it like this:

```js
const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Greetings</h1>
      <Hello name="Maya" age={26 + 10} />
      <footer />
    </div>
    // creates HTML footer element ie; not what we wanted
  );
};
```

- The page is not going to display the `footer` component embedded inside the `App` component
- Instead it creates an empty `<footer>` element, the built-in HTML element instead of the custom React element of the same name.
- Also note that the content of a React element generally is inside a **_root_** element (`div` element in the case of `App` component).
- If we there's no **_root_** element then it will cause an error

```js
const App = () => {
  return (
    <h1>Greetings</h1>
    <Hello name="Maya" age={26 + 10} />
    <Footer />
  )
  // this will result in an error
}
```

- **Using a root element is not the only working option. An array of components is also a valid solution:**

```js
const App = () => {
  return [<h1>Greetings</h1>, <Hello name="Maya" age={26 + 10} />, <Footer />];

  // or as

  /* 
    return [
    <h1>Greetings</h1>,
    <Hello name="Maya" age={26 + 10} />,
    <Footer />
  ]
  */
};
```

- However doing this is adviced against as it makes the code look ugly
- Since a root element is stipulated(a requirement) for the content inside a React component, we have a lot of extra `divs` in the _`DOM-Tree`_
- This can be avoided by using fragments, i.e. by wrapping the elements to be returned by the component with an empty element:

```js
const App = () => {
  const name = "Peter";
  const age = 10;

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Greetings</h1>
      <Hello name="Maya" age={26 + 10} />
      <Hello name={name} age={age} />
      <Footer />
    </>
  );
};
```

**It now compiles successfully, and the DOM generated by React no longer contains the extra div-elements.**

> **WARNING** create-react-app automatically makes the project a git repository unless the application is created within an already existing repository. Most likely you do not want the project to become a repository, so run the command rm -rf .git in the root of the project.
